# mvavgbot
Moving average bot that creates a printed buy statement based on the current bid.

You are now able to select a strategy and candle length. 

When you use candles of 1 minute, 5 minute, and 1 Hour the number of days you can select are limited.

First enter a market.

Then enter a candle length.

Then enter your days count for each moving average calculation.

Then enter your strategy for calculation.

The database will build on entry after the market is selected.

If you do not complete a buy or you stop the program without a command you will need to clear before next use.

This is for use with MongoDB.
